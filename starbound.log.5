[14:56:36.620] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> All life readings emanate from a great depth below the surface. The readings are... Difficult to define. Congratulations in advance for your courage.
[14:56:55.140] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> It appears lockdown has been instigated. You must locate a breaker to restore full power. Please proceed with caution in conditions of low light.
[14:57:53.599] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> I detect both Erchius chemical signatures and human DNA in these entities. High likelihood of behavioural volatility predicted.

[15:02:59.704] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Sorry about the AI, dear.
[15:03:06.944] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Look at them; prolonged contact with the Erchius crystals seems to have denatured their very being! The poor creatures have lost themselves completely.
[15:05:10.138] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> Erchius readings have reached 101 rad. Your current Peril level is 18,472 morts...
[15:05:18.764] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Hush! You're not helping.
[15:07:30.912] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> Conventional weapons have an estimated 0% chance of damaging the Erchius crystal. You are invited to devise another means of attack.
[15:10:17.290] [Info] Chat: <Esther Bright> Well done!
[15:10:20.292] [Info] Chat: <SAIL> There is enough Erchius here to fully repair the ship.
